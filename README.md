This is a Path detection with algorithms Visualizer Web Application! I built this application because I was fascinated by pathfinding algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action.

This application supports the following algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

A Search* (weighted): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

Greedy Best-first Search (weighted): a faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*; does not guarantee the shortest path
